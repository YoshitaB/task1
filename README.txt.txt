Hello Everyone, My name is Yoshita Banerjee and I am from Kolkata, West Bengal. I am very enthusiastic to learn about coding though it is my first time learning about Open-source. My other hobbies include reading novels and I do write articles and poems as well.

I have never worked with open-source before and I am really glad that through the coding week, I got a chance to do so. It is very fun being able to contribute to some programs to modify it in some way and tackle the issues which the program might be facing.
